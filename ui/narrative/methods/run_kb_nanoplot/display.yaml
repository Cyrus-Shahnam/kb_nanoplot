name: Assess Reads Quality with NanoPlot

tooltip: |
  Generate quality assessment graphs for Oxford Nanopore reads.

description: |
  This app runs NanoPlot on a SingleEndLibrary object containing Nanopore FASTQ reads. It produces several plots with information about read quality, length distributions, N50, and cumulative yield for quality assessment and control of read libraries.
